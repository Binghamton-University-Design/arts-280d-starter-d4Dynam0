            This book is a brief look at Labanotiation, a dance notation system
            devoped by Rudolph Laban, for the purpose of communicating movement
            in a written form. As a former ballet dancer, It was surprising to
            have never heard of the system before. It is not widely used or
            taught; but it was an exciting and personally significant topic to
            layout for my first ever book project. These are few excerpts from
            the full book.
